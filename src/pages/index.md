  Operation Gratitude sends 250,000+ individually addressed care packages to
  Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen and Marines deployed overseas, to their children
  left behind, and to New Recruit Graduates, Veterans, First Responders, and
  Wounded Heroes and their Caregivers.  Each package contains food, hygiene,
  entertainment and handmade items, as well as personal letters of support. A
  Care Package brings joy to a Service Member stationed far from home or enables
  a Veteran to feel appreciated -- many for the first time. Our Care Packages
  for Wounded Heroes and Caregivers let them know that they are seen and that
  their great sacrifices for us are honored.
