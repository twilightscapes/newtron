## A few points about this site and who's behind it.

Todd Lambert, a “webdude” that grew up in Southern California and migrated to the Deep South. He then left to explore the western states where he spent the next several years visiting and living in numerous states including Colorado, Texas and Oregon.

Having lived on the Mississippi gulf coast, twice, Todd has assisted many small businesses that were affected by Hurricane Katrina in establishing an online presence. Todd is also actively involved with photography. You can often find him in the middle of the night down some dark alley while doing night photography which is his favorite. Todd is also an avid golfer and loves to play a round of golf just about any time he gets the chance.

Todd is single and has a dog-child and playful Boxer named “Zoe”, that takes up most of his free time.
